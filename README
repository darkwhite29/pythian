(2) When the virtual machine is booted, run "vagrant ssh" in the command line to access the guest box;

(3) On the host, type "10.0.33.18" in a web brower to test if Apache is successfully installed and running with the Vagrantfile provisioner "Option 1: Shell";

(4) On the guest, run "ps -ef | grep mongod" and "ps -ef | grep redis" in the command line to test if MongoDB and Redis are successfully installed and running with the Vagrantfile provisioner "Option 2: Puppet";

(5) On the guest, run "exit" to logout the guest box, and on the host, run "vagrant halt" to shut down the guest box.


2. Web Query (Implemented in Perl)

Files and folders:

"web_query.pl" (file) and "results" (file) under "WebsiteQuery"
